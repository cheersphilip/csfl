Customer Services Call Frequency Log, using CANVAS.

we needed a way for customer services to record the number of calls coming into the call center, for each service team and interaction.

First commit is for a single canvas screen that displays the service teams graphically and can tell which service team has been clicked on.

Second commit fleshes this out with a second level and better graphics

third commit will be integration with database to log call frequencies, as well as possibly scrapping all the repetitive code that creates the button things, instead pulling it from the database.
