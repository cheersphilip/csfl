Customer Services Call Frequency Log, using CANVAS.

we needed a way for customer services to record the number of calls coming into the call center, for each service team and interaction.

First commit is for a single canvas screen that displays the service teams graphically and can tell which service team has been clicked on.

Second commit fleshes this out with a second level and better graphics, as well as incorporating the 'canvas text wrap' function.

Third commit writes to a database to log username, time and, most importantly, the nature of the call. You will need to set up your own database!
